                    As George specified in his reply, the redesign of the website would be considered successful if more people sign up for the newsletter or a 7-Day Membership. Our approach is to target a wider audience from young to old, women and men, fit or unfit. It is our job to make it look more exciting and engaging for all of these groups of people when they land on the Home page.

                    The problem with the current site is that it looks like the gym is for bodybuilders only. It also fails to communicate their strengths such as 
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>It’s locally owned</li>
                    <li>It’s been here for 30 years</li>
                    <li>Over 70 percent of members use the gym regularly</li>
                    <li> Open 24 hours</li>
                    <li>Affordable rates</li>
                    <li>Clean (they have dedicated cleaning staff)</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    This information can be used to differentiate this gym from other giant chains, and should be highlighted on the Home page. (For example, I just happen to live close by and know that there’s a pretty cool food cart park right next to the gym. This totally adds value to the gym and might be beneficial to have next to the map or with the location information.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another problem is that information is scattered across the website, and not organized in a way that is easy for the visitor to digest at once. A lot of information is hidden away in other pages currently. For example, let’s say I would be interested in Yoga classes, but I won’t know that this gym even offers yoga classes until I look at the calendar. Even then, I will probably miss it because the calendar looks overwhelming with the plethora of items and ugly colors and fonts. There are yoga related pictures and videos too, but most likely, I will not see them because I would lose interest before getting into the Media pages. So, we need to present what greatness the gym has to offer right on the Home page, and hopefully the visitors will find something that they are interested in. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The key to success is to present data in a meaningful and impactful way on the Home page. Once we grab the visitors attention, through call to action buttons we can guide them to a separate page that offers more detailed data on the subject. Sorting the information and separating it out by type is worth considering, like showing yoga pictures/videos on the page that talks about yoga classes. That would be more effective in getting people interested in joining the class or the gym. As the month’s schedule is the same weekly schedule, just repeated, it might be better to just show a one week schedule so the visitors will actually want to look at it. And since there are only a handful of classes available, it should have a dedicated page explaining in detail about the class. We could also have the instructor’s profile on the page, which is followed by a link to the Staff page. If there are too many videos, for let’s say the yoga class, then we can show the highest rated two, or the most recent two. This way, members would be more motivated to upload videos. They might even tell their friends if their video is featured. We can again have a link under the selected videos to take them to the page that lists all the yoga videos (or all videos of all kinds).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Lastly, the social icons should probably be at the top right to follow the common convention. Deals offered to business customers also weren’t clear, but let’s assume they have a different rates and benefits to offer if a business signs up as a group. We might not need to show what the deals are per se (I’d assume the gym negotiates them case by case), but we should mention that they do have business membership, and lead them to contact them for more information.﻿
